# What is OS Command Injection
- OS command injection (Also Known as shell injection) is a security vulnerability where an attacker can cause an application to execute unintended operating system commands.

## Useful commands
After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

| Purpose of command |	Linux |	Windows |
|                    |        |         |
| `Name of current user` |	whoami | whoami |
| `Operating system` |	uname -a | ver |
| `Network configuration`|	ifconfig | ipconfig /all |
| `Network connections |	netstat` -an | netstat -an |
| `Running processes` |	ps -ef | tasklist |
